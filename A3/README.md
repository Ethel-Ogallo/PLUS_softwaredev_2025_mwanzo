### A3: SAR Data Processing  
This notebook, demonstrates operations for handling geospatial raster data, specifically Sentinel-1 GRD (Ground Range Detected) products. It serves as an initial step for subsequent tasks within the group project, which aims to be an open-source Python library for SAR data processing. It includes a simple demonstration of how to load and quickly visualize Sentinel-1 GRD data using the defined functions. 

The main geopython library utilized is rasterio
