A3: SAR Data Processing  
This notebook, part of the PySARflow project, demonstrates fundamental operations for handling geospatial raster data, specifically focusing on Sentinel-1 GRD (Ground Range Detected) products. It serves as an initial step for subsequent tasks within the project, which aims to be an open-source Python library for SAR data processing.

The main geopython library utilized is rasterio

The notebook includes a simple demonstration of how to load and quickly visualize Sentinel-1 GRD data using the defined functions. This is an initial task for subsequent project developments.

Note: The sample data folder is excluded from this repository due to file size constraints.
